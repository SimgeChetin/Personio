      - name: gross_revenue
        description: >
          Gross Revenue is recognized on an invoiced basis. 
          For new subscriptions (first month), gross_revenue is equal to the total invoice amount before discounts. 
          For existing subscriptions, gross_revenue is computed as:
          `starting_month_revenue` (last month's revenue before discount) 
          plus any `upgrade_revenue` (e.g. expansion of the plan or added features).
          Downgrades, churn, and discounts are not subtracted here to reflect the full revenue potential before loss or reduction.

      - name: net_revenue
        description: >
          Net revenue is recognized on an invoiced basis and **adjusted** for discounts, churn, 
          upgrades, and downgrades. For new subscriptions, it is calculated as:
          `new_revenue_after_discounts` minus any `downgrade_revenue` in case customer switches to another subcription with less cost.
          For ongoing subscriptions, it is:
          `starting_month_revenue_after_discounts` + `upgrade_revenue` 
          - `downgrade_revenue` - `churn_lost_revenue_after_discounts`. 
          This gives a true picture of retained and recurring revenue for the month after all pricing dynamics.

      - name: gross_revenue_retention
        description: >
          Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) measures the percentage of revenue retained from existing subscriptions,
          excluding any upgrades or new subscriptions. It is calculated as:
          
          (starting_month_revenue_after_discounts - churn_lost_revenue_after_discounts - downgrade_revenue)
          / starting_month_revenue_after_discounts.
          
          This metric excludes revenue from new subscriptions and upgrades, offering a pure view of
          revenue sustainability from existing customers.

      - name: net_revenue_retention
        description: >
          Net Revenue Retention (NRR) measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing subscriptions,
          accounting for the impact of upgrades and downgrades, but excluding new subscriptions.
          It is calculated as:
          
          (starting_month_revenue_after_discounts + upgrade_revenue - churn_lost_revenue_after_discounts - downgrade_revenue)
          / starting_month_revenue_after_discounts.
